# Security Policies

## Authentication

The system uses OAuth2 for authentication across all services. The token-based mechanism ensures secure access control. All sensitive API requests require a valid bearer token.

- **OAuth2 Setup**: Configure OAuth2 authentication using `OAuth2Setup.java`.

## Authorization

Authorization is managed through role-based access control (RBAC). Roles and permissions are defined in the `RBACConfig.yaml` file.

- **Admin**: Full access to all resources.
- **User**: Access to only specific data pipelines and monitoring services.

## Data Encryption

Data encryption is enforced both at rest and in transit.

- **At Rest**: Data is encrypted using `EncryptData.py`, leveraging AES-256 encryption.
- **In Transit**: SSL/TLS certificates are managed using `SSLSetup.sh`.

## Auditing and Compliance

Audit logs are generated for all access and modification actions using `AuditLogs.py`. GDPR compliance is checked using `GDPRComplianceCheck.py`.

- **Audit Logs**: Store all access logs in a secure location with tamper-proof measures.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Regular compliance checks are scheduled.
