# Distributed System Architecture

## Overview

This distributed system is designed to handle large-scale data processing, integrating components for data ingestion, storage, processing, orchestration, monitoring, and security. The architecture is modular, allowing seamless scalability and integration with cloud-based and on-premise infrastructure.

## Core Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Supports batch and real-time ingestion using technologies like Kafka, Kinesis, and custom connectors for databases (SQL/NoSQL).
   - Data cleaning and transformation pipelines in Python and Scala.

2. **Distributed Data Storage**
   - Supports HDFS, object storage (S3), NoSQL (Cassandra), relational databases (Google Cloud Spanner), and data lakes.

3. **Distributed Processing**
   - Batch and real-time processing using Apache Spark, Hadoop, Flink, and Dask.

4. **Orchestration and Workflow Management**
   - Uses Airflow, Luigi, and Argo Workflows to manage complex data pipelines and distributed jobs.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implements Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack for monitoring, alerting, and logging.

6. **Security and Compliance**
   - Features OAuth2-based authentication, RBAC for authorization, data encryption, and GDPR compliance tools.

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

The architecture employs horizontal scalability in both storage and compute layers. Data replication, distributed computing frameworks, and auto-scaling in orchestration provide fault tolerance.
